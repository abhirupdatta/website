<li> [August, 2022] Dr. Datta received an Excellence in Teaching recognition from the Johns Hopkins Bloomgerg School of Public Health for teaching the Probability Theory course in Spring 2022.
<li> [February, 2022] Dr. Datta received an R01 award as a Principal Investigator from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to develop statistical methods for air-pollution data from low-cost sensors.
<li> <a href="https://twitter.com/datta_science/status/1467848101964697607" target="_blank"> [December, 2021] </a> Dr. Datta was awarded the <a href="https://www.intindstat.org/honors-awards?_ga=2.129450508.1688647937.1644511313-884509758.1644511313" target="_blank"> Young Statistical Scientist Award (YSSA) </a> in the Applications category by the International Indian Statistical Association (IISA). This prestigious award recognizes "outstanding contribution made by members in each of the areas of Theory and Methods, Applications and Statistical Practice." The nominees must strictly be under the age of 44 throughout the award calendar year.
<!-- <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/datta_science/status/1463144816712290310" target="_blank"> [November, 2021] </a> Dr. Datta received a grant as a Principal Investigator from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  to develop Bayesian methods for improving global mortality estimates from verbal autopsies.
.
<li> <a href="https://community.amstat.org/envr/recognitionandawards/distinguishedachievementawards" target="_blank"> [May, 2021] </a> I was awarded the Early Investigator Award by the American Statistical Association Section on Statistics and the the Environment (ENVR).-->
</ul>

<large> <hlt2> Research: </hlt2> </large> </br>
<p> Dr. Datta’s research focuses on developing statistical methods for geospatial data
with applications to air pollution, forestry, ecology, infectious disease modeling, and on Bayesian
hierarchical models for multi-source data with applications to global health. Dr. Datta has published in esteemed  statistical or scientific journals like Journal of the American
Statistical Association (JASA), Annals of Statistics (AoS), Annals of Applied Statistics (AoAS),
Biostatistics, Biometrics, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). In
2021, Dr. Datta was awarded the Young Statistical Scientist Award (YSSA) – a prestigious award
by the International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) for early and mid career researchers.</p> </br>

<hlt2> Spatial and environmental research: </hlt2> </br>
<p> Dr. Datta has been leading highly innovative and impactful
research in spatial statistics and machine learning for analysis of large and complex environmental
data. His work on Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP) has become one of the most
widely used methods for scalable analysis of massive geospatial data. The original NNGP paper
led by Dr. Datta is one of the top-5 most cited papers published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association from 2016-2020. Dr. Datta was awarded the 2021 Early
Investigator Award by the American Statistical Association (ASA) Section on Statistics and the
Environment (ENVR) for contributions to spatial big data methodology and their environmental
applications. As principal investigator, Dr. Datta has been awarded an R01 grant by the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and an NSF grant for development of spatial methods. </p> </br>

<p> Currently, Dr. Datta is working on spatial methods for hyper-local air pollution data from low-cost sensors networs, and on combining machine learning methods (random forests and neural networks) with traditional spatial methods like Gaussian processes to develop hybrid and structured spatial machine learning approaches.  </p> </br>

<hlt2> Global health research: </hlt2> </br>
<p> Dr. Datta has been developing Bayesian methods to understand disease
burden from multi-source data in many low and middle income countries (LMICS). He is currently leading a high impact global health project aimed to improve cause-specific mortality estimates for children and neonates. Dr. Datta has
demonstrated that the estimates of mortality in LMICS, often derived from verbal autopsies, are
highly biased and has developed Bayesian transfer learning methods for bias-correction of verbal
autopsy. He has been recently awarded a grant PI grant by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
for broader application of the method to improve cause-specific mortality estimates globally. </p> </br>


<!--  My research interests are diverse. One line of research focuses on methods for spatio-temporal data -- graphical models, spatial machine learning (Gaussian Processes and random forests), fast Bayesian algorithms for high-dimensional spatial data.
  These methods research usually emerge from my collaborations with researchers in areas of air pollution and environmental health. One exciting current project involves statistical calibration of hyper local air-pollution data from low-cost monitors.-->

<!--<p>
</br>
  I also work on hierarchical models, Bayesian machine learning and shrinkage (regularization) methods for  <!--, and computational methods for big (high-dimensional) data.-->
 <!--The methods research usually emerge from my collaborations with researchers in areas of air pollution and environmental health, epidemiology and international health.
 Currently, I'm working on spatial methods for hyper-local air pollution data and Bayesian machine learning approaches
  complex survey-based datasets arising from epidemiological field work. Current applications include small area estimation using misaligned and partly-missing survey summaries, quantification learning of child mortality rates. <!--, and methods and software development for massive spatio-temporal data.-->
 <!--I have also recently got involved in applications of spatial statistics in neuroimaging and genetics.
