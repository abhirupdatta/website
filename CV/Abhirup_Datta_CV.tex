\subsection*{Software}

\myben{0.4em}

\item
{\bf BRISC} $\blacktriangleright$
BRISC is an R-package on CRAN for rapid estimation, prediction and inference for large spatial data in a frequentist setup. BRISC estimation and prediction relies on nearest neighbor approximations of the spatial Gaussian Process likelihood, and uses a scalable paramteric bootstrap to provide inference for all spatial parameters. To our knowledge, currently BRISC is the only R-package that provides confidence intervals in a frequentist setup for all parameters including the spatial variance and range of Gaussian Process. Inference from BRISC is highly competitive with those obtained on Bayesian approaches relying on MCMC, while being manifold times faster.
\item
{\bf calibratedVA} $\blacktriangleright$
calibatedVA is an R-package on Github for local calibration of national and sub-national cause specific mortality (CSMF) estimates produced by algortihms based on verbal autopsy data. These computer coded verbal autopsy (CCVA) algorithms usually rely on non-local gold standard training data and can be inaccurate in a local context. calibratedVA uses the output of the CCVA algorithm and limited amount of local gold standard data to update the CSMF estimates using a fast Bayesian hierarchical model. calibratedVA also has an ensemble calibration option where outputs from multiple CCVA algorithms are used to produce an unified calibrated CSMF estimate. the package can also be used in other general contexts to calibrate any discrete classifier (or a set of classifiers) based on limited local labeled data.
\item 
{\bf spNNGP} $\blacktriangleright$
spNNGP is an R package on CRAN for fully Bayesian analysis of massive spatial data. Spatial analysis of point process data is usually computationally expensive requiring memory and computations that are quadratic and cubic in the number of locations where data is observed. spNNGP implements a class of scalable Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process models that uses memory and computations that are linear in the size of the data. spNNGP enables fast fully Bayesian inference of all parameters and proper uncertainty quantified predictions at new locations. An MCMC-free hybrid Bayesian conjugate NNGP is also included which is super fast even for spatial datasets with millions of locations.
